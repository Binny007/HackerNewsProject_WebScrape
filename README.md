# Our Hacker News Project

--> So in this project I will be building a useful project by web scraping the HackerNews website(URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/news).

--> I want to build a nicer version of Hacker News. You see, every morning as a programmer, we wakeup and usually read Hacker News because
    its a great way for ourself to stay up to date with the industry and just learn about general programming news. They have some really 
    nice article here and a lot of programmers use Hacker News as a way to stay up to date with the industry. So the Hacker News is a fast
    paced website, that is as soon as if you refresh the page, it's a new topic, because you get  a lot of people post news links here to
    get traction, because there's so many readers here.

--> Now in order for us not to get overwhelmed, I usually only like reading or checking our the stories that have over 100 points, that is,
    they've been upvoted by users.

--> Let's build the tool using web scraping that when I wake up in the morning, instead of having to scroll through each page and find out all the
    stories that have over 100 points, because those are the most popular or most important ones, let's scrape this data and then remove all
    the stories that have less than 100 points, so that we can only focus on the important news articles.   

--> In order for us to scrape the Hacker News website, we want to use a tool for python called "Beautiful Soup". It's a library that we
    can use in python to scrape websites.
